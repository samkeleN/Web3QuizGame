To enable the app to reward users with NFTs or Celo-based tokens based on correct answers, the following steps should be implemented:

### Backend Changes
1. **Smart Contract Development**:
   - Create or update a smart contract to handle rewards distribution.
   - The contract should:
     - Mint NFTs or transfer Celo-based tokens to the user's wallet.
     - Accept parameters such as the user's wallet address and the number of correct answers.

2. **API Endpoint**:
   - Add a new API endpoint (e.g., `/api/reward`) to interact with the smart contract.
   - This endpoint should:
     - Accept the user's wallet address and score.
     - Call the smart contract to distribute rewards.

3. **Integration with Celo SDK**:
   - Use the Celo SDK to interact with the blockchain for token transfers or NFT minting.

### Frontend Changes
1. **Reward Button**:
   - Add a button to claim rewards after the quiz is completed.
   - The button should trigger a function to call the `/api/reward` endpoint.

2. **Feedback to Users**:
   - Display a success or error message after the reward is claimed.
   - Optionally, show the transaction hash or a link to the blockchain explorer.

### Smart Contract Deployment
1. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - Deploy the smart contract to the Celo blockchain.
   - Update the frontend with the contract address.

2. **Verify the Contract**:
   - Verify the contract on the Celo blockchain for transparency.

### Security and Best Practices
1. **Validation**:
   - Validate the user's score before rewarding.
   - Ensure the wallet address is valid.

2. **Gas Optimization**:
   - Optimize the smart contract to minimize gas fees.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Handle errors gracefully in both the backend and frontend.

---

### Optional Enhancements
1. **Leaderboard**:
   - Add a leaderboard to display top scorers and their rewards.

2. **Dynamic Rewards**:
   - Adjust rewards based on the difficulty level or score.

3. **Analytics**:
   - Track reward distribution and user engagement.
